  * Question 2. Write a method that finds a Hamiltonian path in a Wikipedia page graph. 
  * A Hamiltonian path is any path in some graph that visits every vertex exactly once. 
  * This method will never be called for graphs with more than 20 pages. 
  * See (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) for more information about Hamiltonian paths.

  * A strongly connected component is a set of vertices such that there is a path 
  * between every ordered pair of vertices in the strongly connected component. 
  * See (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) for more information about strongly connected components.
